# Challenge-13

## What did I learn?
I learned how to write in multiple routes for the database. I also got the hang of file locations and management since there are more added as we get closer to project time. 

## What I still need to focus on?
I still am having trouble on pulling the information from Insomnia to be able to complete the objective on recording a video.
